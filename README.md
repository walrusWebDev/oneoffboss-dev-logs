# **OneOffBoss \- Development Logs**

## **Purpose**

This repository serves as an automated archive for daily development logs related to the **OneOffBoss** project (e.g., One Off Boss website, OcalaRepair App, etc.).

These logs are generated using the [**WP Dev Habit**](https://wp-devhabit.com) WordPress plugin, a tool designed to build a consistent habit of documenting the development process.

## **Structure**

Log files are automatically committed to this repository by the WP Dev Habit plugin.

* Files are stored in the /\_logs/ directory (or the root, depending on plugin configuration).  
* Each file is named using the format YYYY-MM-DD-log.md.  
* The content of each file is Markdown generated from the plugin's guided journaling prompts.
